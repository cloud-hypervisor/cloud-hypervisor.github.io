Bypass Mode for virtio-iommu # virtio-iommu specification describes how a device can be attached by default to a bypass domain. This feature is particularly helpful for booting a VM with guest software which doesn&amp;rsquo;t support virtio-iommu but still need to access the device. Now that Cloud Hypervisor supports this feature, it can boot a VM with Rust Hypervisor Firmware or OVMF even if the virtio-block device exposing the disk image is placed behind a virtual IOMMU.</description></item><item><title>Achieving Bare Metal Performance Within a Virtual Machine</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/achieving-bare-metal-performance-within-a-virtual-machine/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/achieving-bare-metal-performance-within-a-virtual-machine/</guid><description>There are use cases for which a workload needs to access specific hardware such as accelerators, GPU or network adapters to maximise potential performance. And since these workloads run inside virtual machines (VM) for security reasons, the challenge is to make this hardware available from within the VM, but without degrading the performance that can be achieved from bare metal.
VFIO, the Ideal Choice # This is a mature framework allowing a PCI device to be bound to the vfio-pci driver instead of the default driver it is usually attached to.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v23.1 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v23.1-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 14:24:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v23.1-released/</guid><description>This is a bug fix release.

vDPA Support # A vDPA device has a datapath that complies with the virtio specification but with a vendor specific control path. The addition of --vdpa and the REST API equivalent allows the use of these devices with Cloud Hypervisor.
Updated OS Support list # The list of officially supported and tested OS versions has been updated to include Ubuntu &amp;ldquo;jammy&amp;rdquo; 22.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v22.1 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v22.1-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 09:09:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v22.1-released/</guid><description>This is a bug fix release.

GDB Debug Stub Support # Cloud Hypervisor can now be used as debug target with GDB. This is controlled by the gdb compile time feature and details of how to use it can be found in the gdb documentation.
virtio-iommu Backed Segments # In order to facilitate hotplug devices that require being behind an IOMMU (e.g. QAT) there is a new option --platform iommu_segments=&amp;lt;list_of_segments&amp;gt; that will place all the specified segments behind the IOMMU.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v21.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v21.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:31:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v21.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v21.0 project.
Efficient Local Live Migration (for Live Upgrade) # In order to support fast live upgrade of the VMM an optimised path has been added in which the memory for the VM is not compared from source to destination. This is activated by passing --local to the ch-remote send-migration command. This means that the live upgrade can complete in the order of 50ms vs 3s.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v20.2 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.2-released/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.2-released/</guid><description>This is a bug fix release.

File-level Locking Support with --disk # Now file-level locking is enforced for disk images, provided by users with --disk. This ensures that only a single Cloud Hypervisor instance can obtain write access to a given disk image at any time, preventing misconfiguration and avoiding potential data corruption. (#6974)

Improved Downtime of VM Live Migration # The downtime of VM live migration is reduced via delaying some of the tearing down process of the source VM after the destination VM is up and running.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v44.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v44.0-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 19:34:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v44.0-released/</guid><description>v44.0 # This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v44.0. The following user visible changes have been made:
Configurable virtio-iommu Address Width # The iommu_address_width option has been added to --platform to allow users to limit the virtio-iommu address space in the guest. (#6900)
Notable Performance Improvements # The VIRTIO_BLK_F_SEG_MAX feature has been enabled for virtio-block devices, which brings significant performance improvements on throughput. (#6885)
The io_uring entries are no longer forced to use async helper workers, delegating the decision to the kernel.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v43.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v43.0-released/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 21:31:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v43.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v43.0.

The following user visible changes have been made:
Experimental &amp;ldquo;Pvmemcontrol&amp;rdquo; Support # VMM support has been added for this experimental functionality (requires currently out of tree Linux kernel patches) to allow guests to control its physical memory properties to allow optimisations and security features. (#6318, #6467)
Sandboxing With Landlock Support # Support for restricting the VMM process using the Linux kernel &amp;ldquo;Landlock&amp;rdquo; API has been added - this can be used to restrict the files (and the read/write permissions) that the VMM process can access.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v40.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v40.0-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2024 11:12:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v40.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v40.0. The following user visible changes have been made:
Support for Restoring File Descriptor Backed Network Devices # It is now possible to pass file descriptors over the HTTP API (and using ch-remote) when restoring to update the file descriptors for network devices. This enables snapshot &amp;amp; restore functionality for guests using macvtap or other file descriptor backed network devices.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v39.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v39.0-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 13:40:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v39.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v39.0. The following user visible changes have been made:
Variable Sizing of PCI Apertures for Segments # It is now possible to use --pci-segment to adjust the aperture size that devices 32-bit and 64-bit PCI device BARs will be allocated from. Previously the address space was equally distributed across all the segments which may leave insufficient space for devices that require a large 32-bit space.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v38.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v38.0-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 18:20:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v38.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v38.0.

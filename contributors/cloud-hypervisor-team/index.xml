Bypass Mode for virtio-iommu # virtio-iommu specification describes how a device can be attached by default to a bypass domain. This feature is particularly helpful for booting a VM with guest software which doesn&amp;rsquo;t support virtio-iommu but still need to access the device. Now that Cloud Hypervisor supports this feature, it can boot a VM with Rust Hypervisor Firmware or OVMF even if the virtio-block device exposing the disk image is placed behind a virtual IOMMU.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v23.1 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v23.1-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 14:24:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v23.1-released/</guid><description>This is a bug fix release.

The following user visible changes have been made:
Support for Restoring File Descriptor Backed Network Devices # It is now possible to pass file descriptors over the HTTP API (and using ch-remote) when restoring to update the file descriptors for network devices. This enables snapshot &amp;amp; restore functionality for guests using macvtap or other file descriptor backed network devices.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v39.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v39.0-released/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 13:40:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v39.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v39.0. The following user visible changes have been made:
Variable Sizing of PCI Apertures for Segments # It is now possible to use --pci-segment to adjust the aperture size that devices 32-bit and 64-bit PCI device BARs will be allocated from. Previously the address space was equally distributed across all the segments which may leave insufficient space for devices that require a large 32-bit space.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v38.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v38.0-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 18:20:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v38.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v38.0.

Long Term Support (LTS) Release # This release is a LTS release. Point releases for bug fixes will be made for the next 18 months; live migration and live upgrade will be supported between the point releases of the LTS.
Multiple PCI segments Support for 32-bit VFIO Devices # Now VFIO devices with 32-bit memory BARs can be attached to non-zero PCI segments on the guest, allowing users to have more 32-bit devices and assign such devices to appropriate NUMA nodes for better performance.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v36.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v36.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 16:06:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v36.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v36.0. The following user visible changes have been made:
Command Line Changes # We switched back to use the clap crate to create our command line, since the argh crate is barely maintained. There were several syntax changes:
All --option value commands now are --option=value. The --disk DISK1 --disk DISK2 command now is --disk DISK1 DISK2. The -v -v -vcommand now is -vvv.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v35.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v35.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 14:47:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v35.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v35.0. The following user visible changes have been made:
virtio-vsock Support for Linux Guest Kernel v6.3+ # Since kernel v6.3, a vsock packet can be included in a single descriptor, instead of being split over two descriptors. Our virtio-vsock implementation now support both situations.
User Specified Serial Number for virtio-block # A new option serial is added to the --block command that allows users to specify a serial number for block devices which will be guest visible.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v34.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v34.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 16:44:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v34.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v34.0.

Paravirtualised Panic Device Support # A new device has been added that can communicate when the guest kernel has panicked and share those details with the VMM. This is controlled with a new --pvpanic command line option and JSON API change equivalent. (#5526)
Improvements to VM Core Dump # Requesting to dump the guest memory as core dump will now transparently pause the VM if required; returning to the original state after.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v33.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v33.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 17:32:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v33.0-released/</guid><description>v33.0 # This release has been tracked in our roadmap project as iteration v33.0.

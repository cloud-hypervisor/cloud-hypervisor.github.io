SMBIOS Improvements via --platform # --platform and the appropriate API structure has gained support for supplying OEM strings (primarily used to communicate metadata to systemd in the guest) (#4319, #4446) and support for specifying the UUID (#4389.)
Unified Binary MSHV and KVM Support # Support for both the MSHV and KVM hypervisors can be compiled into the same binary with the detection of the hypervisor to use made at runtime.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v25.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v25.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 14:59:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v25.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v25.0 project.
ch-remote Improvements # The ch-remote command has gained support for creating the VM from a JSON config and support for booting and deleting the VM from the VMM.
VM &amp;ldquo;Coredump&amp;rdquo; Support # Under the guest_debug feature flag it is now possible to extract the memory of the guest for use in debugging with e.g. the crash utility. (#4012)
Notable Bug Fixes # Always restore console mode on exit (#4249, #4248) Restore vCPUs in numerical order which fixes aarch64 snapshot/restore (#4244) Don&amp;rsquo;t try and configure IFF_RUNNING on TAP devices (#4279) Propagate configured queue size through to vhost-user backend (#4286) Always Program vCPU CPUID before running the vCPU to fix running on Linux 5.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v24.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v24.0-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v24.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v24.0 project.
Bypass Mode for virtio-iommu # virtio-iommu specification describes how a device can be attached by default to a bypass domain. This feature is particularly helpful for booting a VM with guest software which doesn&amp;rsquo;t support virtio-iommu but still need to access the device. Now that Cloud Hypervisor supports this feature, it can boot a VM with Rust Hypervisor Firmware or OVMF even if the virtio-block device exposing the disk image is placed behind a virtual IOMMU.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v23.1 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v23.1-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 14:24:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v23.1-released/</guid><description>This is a bug fix release.

vDPA Support # A vDPA device has a datapath that complies with the virtio specification but with a vendor specific control path. The addition of --vdpa and the REST API equivalent allows the use of these devices with Cloud Hypervisor.
Updated OS Support list # The list of officially supported and tested OS versions has been updated to include Ubuntu &amp;ldquo;jammy&amp;rdquo; 22.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v22.1 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v22.1-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 09:09:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v22.1-released/</guid><description>This is a bug fix release.

GDB Debug Stub Support # Cloud Hypervisor can now be used as debug target with GDB. This is controlled by the gdb compile time feature and details of how to use it can be found in the gdb documentation.
virtio-iommu Backed Segments # In order to facilitate hotplug devices that require being behind an IOMMU (e.g. QAT) there is a new option --platform iommu_segments=&amp;lt;list_of_segments&amp;gt; that will place all the specified segments behind the IOMMU.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v21.0 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v21.0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:31:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v21.0-released/</guid><description>This release has been tracked through the v21.0 project.
Efficient Local Live Migration (for Live Upgrade) # In order to support fast live upgrade of the VMM an optimised path has been added in which the memory for the VM is not compared from source to destination. This is activated by passing --local to the ch-remote send-migration command. This means that the live upgrade can complete in the order of 50ms vs 3s.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Hypervisor v20.2 Released!</title><link>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.2-released/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:57:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cloudhypervisor.org/blog/cloud-hypervisor-v20.2-released/</guid><description>This is a bug fix release.
